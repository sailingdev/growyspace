If you do not agree to this contract (“Contract” or “User Agreement”), do not click “Join Growyspace” (or similar) and do not access or otherwise use any of our Services. If you wish to terminate this contract, at any time you can do so by closing your account and no longer accessing or using our Services.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            1.1.2. Growyspace
            </h4>
            <p>You are entering into this Contract with Growyspace (also referred to as “we” and “us”). We use the term “Designated Countries” to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.</p>

            <p>If you reside in the “Designated Countries”, you are entering into this Contract with Growyspace, which will be the controller of your personal data provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with our Services.</p>

            <p>As a Visitor or Member of our Services, the collection, use and sharing of your personal data is subject to the [Privacy policy].</p>     
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            1.2. Members and visitors
            </h4>   
            <p>When you register and join Growyspace, you become a Member. If you have chosen not to register for our Services, you may access certain features as a “Visitor”.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            1.3. Change
            </h4>  
            <p>
            We may modify this Contract, our Privacy Policy and our Cookies Policy from time to time. If we make material changes to it, we will provide you notice through our Services, or by other means, to provide you the opportunity to review the changes before they become effective. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. Your continued use of our Services after we publish or send a notice about our changes to these terms means that you are consenting to the updated terms as of their effective date.
            </p>
            <h3 style="margin-top:56px">
            2. Obligations
            </h3>
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            2.1. Service eligibility
            </h4>
            <p>The Services are not for use by anyone under the age of 16.</p>

            <p>To use the Services, you agree that: (1) you must be the “Minimum Age” (described below) or older; (2) you will only have one Growyspace account, which must be in your real name; and (3) you are not already restricted by Growyspace from using the Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms, including accounts registered on behalf of others or persons under the age of 16.</p>

            <p>“Minimum Age” means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Growyspace to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            2.2. Your account
            </h4>
            <p>
            Members are account holders. You agree to: (1) use a strong password and keep it confidential; (2) not transfer any part of your account (e.g., connections) and (3) follow the law and our list of Dos and Don’ts and other professional policies. You are responsible for anything that happens through your account unless you close it or report misuse.</p>

            <p>As between you and others (including your employer), your account belongs to you. However, if the Services were purchased by another party for you to use (e.g. Recruiter seat bought by your employer), the party paying for such Service has the right to control access to and get reports on your use of such paid Service; however, they do not have rights to your personal account.
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            2.3. Payment
            </h4>
            <p>
            If you buy any of our paid Services (“Advanced/sourcing Services”), you agree to pay us the applicable fees and taxes and to additional terms specific to the paid Services. Failure to pay these fees will result in the termination of your paid Services. Also, you agree that:</p>

            <p>Your purchase may be subject to foreign exchange fees or differences in prices based on location (e.g. exchange rates).</p>

            <p>We may store and continue billing your payment method (e.g. credit card) even after it has expired, to avoid interruptions in your Services and to use to pay other Services you may buy.</p>


            <p>If you purchase a subscription, your payment method automatically will be charged at the start of each subscription period for the fees and taxes applicable to that period. To avoid future charges, cancel before the renewal date. </p>

            <p>All of your purchases of Services are subject to Growyspace’s [Refund policies]</p>

            <p>We may calculate taxes payable by you based on the billing information that you provide us at the time of purchase.</p>

            <p>You can get a copy of your invoice through Growyspace.</p>

            <p>
            You agree that we will provide notices and messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) sent to the contact information you provided us (e.g., email, mobile number, physical address). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:56px">
            2.5. Sharing
            </h4>
            <p>
            Our Services allow messaging and sharing of information in many ways, such as your profile, Open-to-work cards, articles, Posts, links to news articles, Opportunities, messages and emails. Where we have made settings available, we will honor the choices you make about who can see content or information. For Opportunity or talent seeking activities, we default to not notifying your connections network or the public. So, if you signal that you are interested in an opportunity, or an open-to-work card, our default is to share it only with the owner.</p>

            <p>We are not obligated to publish any information or content on our Service and can remove it with or without notice.

            GROWYSPACE AND ITS AFFILIATES MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ABOUT THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY REPRESENTATION THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, AND PROVIDE THE SERVICES (INCLUDING CONTENT AND INFORMATION) ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

            The limitations of liability in this Section 4 are part of the basis of the bargain between you and Growyspace and shall apply to all claims of liability (e.g., warranty, tort, negligence, contract and law) even if Growyspace has been told of the possibility of any such damage, and even if these remedies fail their essential purpose.</p>

            <p>These limitations of liability do not apply to liability for death or personal injury or for fraud, gross negligence or intentional misconduct, or in cases of negligence where a material obligation has been breached, a material obligation being such which forms a prerequisite to our delivery of services and on which you may reasonably rely, but only to the extent that the damages were directly caused by the breach and were foreseeable upon conclusion of this Contract and to the extent that they are typical in the context of this Contract.
            </p>
            <h3 style="margin-top:56px">

            7. General terms
            </h3>
            <p>
            If a court with authority over this Contract finds any part of it unenforceable, you and we agree that the court should modify the terms to make that part enforceable while still achieving its intent. </p>

            <p>If the court cannot do that, you and we agree to ask the court to remove that unenforceable part and still enforce the rest of this Contract.<p>

            <p>This Contract (including additional terms that may be provided by us when you engage with a feature of the Services) is the only agreement between us regarding the Services and supersedes all prior agreements for the Services.</p>

            <p>If we don't act to enforce a breach of this Contract, that does not mean that Growyspace has waived its right to enforce this Contract. You may not assign or transfer this Contract (or your membership or use of Services) to anyone without our consent.
